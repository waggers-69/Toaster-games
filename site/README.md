# ⭐ Sparkly — Main Site  
A lightweight, Expo-powered React Native web experience for Sparkly Games, exported using Expo's static web rendering for fast, portable deployment.

---

## 📖 Overview

Sparkly’s main site is built with **React Native + Expo**, then exported as a static web bundle.  
This lets us keep a single codebase that works on web and native, while still delivering snappy load times and simple hosting on Vercel, Netlify, Render, and more.

---

## 🚀 Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparkly-games/main-site.git
cd main-site
npm install
npm run start
```

This starts the Expo development server, letting you preview the site in the browser or any Expo-friendly environment.
